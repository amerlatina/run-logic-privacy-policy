Run Logic Notion Integration – Privacy Policy

Last Updated: October 30, 2025

1. Overview

Run Logic (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides a Notion integration that allows users to connect their Notion account to enhance their Run Logic experience — such as saving run summaries, training notes, or motivational insights directly to their Notion workspace.

This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data when you connect your Notion account to Run Logic or authorize the Run Logic GPT Action to access your Notion workspace.

2. Information We Collect

When you connect your Notion account, we may receive the following information through Notion’s API:

Basic account details (workspace name, workspace ID).

The content of pages or databases you choose to create or update through the integration.

Authentication tokens that enable secure, limited access to your Notion workspace.

We do not collect or store any personal information beyond what is necessary to perform the requested action (e.g., creating or updating a page).

3. How We Use the Information

We use this data solely to:

Authenticate and maintain your secure connection with Notion.

Perform actions that you explicitly request (e.g., create, update, or retrieve a Notion page).

Improve the Run Logic user experience and ensure reliable operation of the integration.

Your Notion data is never sold, shared, or used for advertising purposes.

4. Data Storage and Retention

We do not permanently store any Notion content.
Access tokens are securely transmitted and temporarily stored only as needed to complete authorized requests.
Once your session ends or you revoke authorization, the connection and tokens are invalidated immediately.

5. Data Sharing

We do not share any user data with third parties.
All API communication occurs directly between Run Logic’s GPT integration and Notion’s secure API endpoints using HTTPS and OAuth 2.0.

6. User Control and Revocation

You can disconnect the Run Logic integration at any time:

From within Notion’s “Connected Apps” settings.

By removing authorization from your GPT Actions connections.

Once disconnected, Run Logic will no longer have access to your Notion data.

7. Security

All data transmissions between Run Logic and Notion are encrypted using SSL/TLS.
We follow industry-standard practices for secure authentication, token management, and API calls.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be reflected with an updated “Last Updated” date at the top of this document.
