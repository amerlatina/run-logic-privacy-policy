# Privacy Policy for My GPT (Spotify + Email Actions)

_Last updated: October 2025_

This Privacy Policy describes how this custom GPT ("the GPT") uses and processes data when you interact with it through OpenAI’s ChatGPT platform.

## 1. Data Handling
- The GPT does not store, collect, or retain any personal data outside of OpenAI’s systems.
- Any data sent to third-party APIs (e.g., Spotify or SendGrid) is transmitted securely and only for the purpose of fulfilling the requested actions (like creating playlists or sending emails).
- The GPT itself has no access to users’ Spotify credentials; authentication is handled directly between the user and Spotify via OAuth.

## 2. Third-Party Services
This GPT uses:
- **Spotify Web API** — for searching and creating playlists.  
  See Spotify’s Privacy Policy: [https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/](https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/)
- **SendGrid API** — for sending emails.  
  See SendGrid’s Privacy Policy: [https://sendgrid.com/policies/privacy/](https://sendgrid.com/policies/privacy/)

## 3. Data Storage
This GPT does not store user data, playlist content, or email addresses. Any transient information is processed only within the session.

## 4. Contact
For any concerns, contact the developer of this GPT through GitHub Issues on this repository.
